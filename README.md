Database!

In this project, I add web access to the Contacts app, now when you add or edit a contact, you have two additional options:
    
    1. Load from cloud, this will fetch data from the server and save the data as a new contact or edit an exsiting contact       with the data feched by your choice 
    2. Save to cloud, this will post the current contact to the server
